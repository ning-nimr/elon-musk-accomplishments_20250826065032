            <h2>Introduction: Who is Elon Musk?</h2>
            <p>Elon Musk, born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, is a prominent entrepreneur and business magnate known for his leadership roles in several high-profile technology companies. As the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner of X (formerly Twitter); and founder of The Boring Company and Neuralink, Musk has established himself as one of the most influential innovators of the 21st century.</p>
            <p>With a net worth estimated at $393 billion as of 2025, Musk is considered the world's richest person. His ambitious vision spans multiple industries, from electric vehicles and renewable energy to space exploration and neural technology, all united by a common goal: to address humanity's most pressing challenges and secure a sustainable future.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born to Maye Musk, a Canadian-born model and dietitian, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer. He has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca. Musk's early interest in computing led him to teach himself programming at the age of 10, and by 12, he sold a BASIC-based game called Blastar to a magazine for approximately $500.</p>
            <p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. To avoid mandatory military service in apartheid-era South Africa and to facilitate his move to the United States, he applied for a Canadian passport through his mother.</p>
            <p>In June 1989, Musk moved to Canada, where he lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan and worked various jobs, including on a farm and at a lumber mill. In 1990, he enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, and two years later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. There, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the Wharton School.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at Pinnacle Research Institute, focusing on energy storage, and another at Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted into a Ph.D. program in materials science at Stanford University but left after two days to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in the burgeoning internet industry.</p>

            <h2>Founding of Zip2 and X.com/PayPal</h2>
            <p>Elon Musk's entrepreneurial journey began with the founding of Zip2 in 1995. Alongside his brother Kimbal Musk and Greg Kouri, Musk established Zip2 to provide online business directories and maps for newspapers, effectively creating an internet version of the yellow pages. The company secured contracts with major publications like <em>The New York Times</em> and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million, with Musk receiving $22 million for his 7% stake.</p>
            <p>Following the sale of Zip2, Musk co-founded X.com in 1999, an online financial services and email payment company. X.com was among the first federally insured online banks and attracted over 200,000 customers within its initial months. In 2000, X.com merged with Confinity, a company that had developed a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged entity focused on the PayPal service, which gained popularity for facilitating online payments, especially on platforms like eBay.</p>
            <p>In 2001, the company rebranded as PayPal, and in 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion in stock. Musk, as the largest shareholder with an 11.72% stake, received $175.8 million from the sale. These ventures laid the foundation for Musk's subsequent enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, marking the beginning of his influential presence in the technology and automotive industries.</p>

            <h2>SpaceX: Revolutionizing Space Exploration</h2>
            <p>SpaceX, officially known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company founded by Elon Musk in 2002. The company's mission is to reduce space transportation costs and enable the colonization of Mars.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>Early Developments and Milestones</h3>
            <p>In its initial years, SpaceX developed the Falcon 1, a small-lift launch vehicle. After three unsuccessful attempts, Falcon 1 achieved orbit on September 28, 2008, marking the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to do so. This success led to a $1.6 billion contract with NASA for cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
            
            <h3>Advancements in Reusability</h3>
            <p>SpaceX introduced the Falcon 9 rocket in 2010, designed for reusability. On December 22, 2015, the company achieved the first successful landing of an orbital-class rocket's first stage on land. This was followed by the first successful landing on an ocean platform on April 8, 2016. These milestones significantly reduced launch costs and revolutionized the space industry.</p>

            <h3>Crewed Missions and Starship Development</h3>
            <p>In May 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to send humans into orbit with the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission, transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS. The company is also developing Starship, a fully reusable spacecraft intended for missions to Mars and beyond. Starship aims to carry large payloads and up to 100 passengers, with the goal of making interplanetary travel feasible.</p>
            
            <h3>Recent Achievements</h3>
            <p>In August 2025, SpaceX prepared for the tenth test flight of its Starship rocket, aiming to achieve key milestones in reusability and performance. The mission included ambitious tests such as a soft water landing of the Super Heavy booster and orbital maneuvers by the Starship upper stage.</p>

            <h3>Automotive Achievements</h3>
            <p>In 2023, Tesla's Model Y became the world's best-selling vehicle, surpassing the Toyota Corolla and marking the first time an electric vehicle achieved this milestone. By March 2024, Tesla produced its six millionth car, underscoring its rapid production growth. The company also operates approximately 7,500 Supercharger stations with over 70,000 connectors worldwide, facilitating long-distance travel for EV owners.</p>
            
            <h3>Financial Performance</h3>

            <h3>Workplace Practices and Employee Relations</h3>
            <p>X (formerly Twitter) reached a tentative settlement in a $500 million class-action lawsuit filed by former employees over unpaid severance. The lawsuit represents thousands of workers dismissed after Musk's acquisition of Twitter in 2022. Musk has also expressed negative views on trade unions, with the National Labor Relations Board having 24 open investigations into his companies as of 2025.</p>
            
            <h3>Public Statements and Political Involvement</h3>
            <p>During Donald Trump's second inauguration, Musk performed a gesture interpreted by some as a Nazi or Roman salute, drawing condemnation from various politicians and organizations. His endorsement of Germany's far-right party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), has also been particularly contentious.</p>
